\section{Conclusion}
\label{sec:conclusion}

This paper introduced a hybrid predictive maintenance framework for turbofan engines, leveraging the CMAPSS dataset. By employing unsupervised clustering (KMeans) to define data-driven degradation stages, we moved beyond standard RUL prediction. Our four-phase approach integrated classification (using KNN, GNB, LogReg) to predict the current health stage and regression (using Ridge, XGBoost) to estimate time-to-next-stage, culminating in a novel Risk Score combining probability and urgency proxies for maintenance decision support. Experiments demonstrated the feasibility of deriving and predicting multi-stage health states, with the Risk Score offering a potentially valuable tool for operational planning.

Limitations include the use of simulated data and sensitivity to clustering choices. Future work could involve real-world data validation, exploring advanced clustering and time-series models, refining the Risk Score formulation, and incorporating domain knowledge more formally. Overall, this work presents a step towards more granular and actionable predictive maintenance through hybrid modeling and data-driven health staging.
