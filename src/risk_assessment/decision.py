    Alert Threshold Tuning Strategy:
    The alert threshold for the normalized risk score is critical for balancing
    early warnings against false alarms. Tuning this threshold typically involves:

    1.  Historical Data: Requires a dataset where actual failures or necessary
        maintenance actions are known. This dataset should include the calculated
        risk scores leading up to these events.

    2.  Evaluation Metric: Define what constitutes a "good" alert. Common metrics include:
        - Precision: Of all alerts, how many were true positives (led to actual issues)?
        - Recall (Sensitivity): Of all actual issues, how many were caught by an alert?
        - F1-score: Harmonic mean of Precision and Recall.
        - False Alarm Rate: How many alerts were false positives?

    3.  Precision-Recall Curve: Vary the threshold from 0 to 1. For each threshold,
        calculate Precision and Recall. Plotting these values creates a
        Precision-Recall (PR) curve. The goal is to find a threshold on this
        curve that offers an acceptable trade-off for the specific application.
        The "elbow" of the PR curve or a point that maximizes F1-score are
        common choices.

    4.  Cost-Benefit Analysis: In some industrial settings, the cost of a missed
        detection (catastrophic failure) vs. the cost of a false alarm
        (unnecessary inspection/maintenance) can be quantified. The threshold
        can then be optimized to minimize overall operational cost.

    5.  Domain Expertise: Maintenance engineers and domain experts should be
        involved in validating the chosen threshold and alerting logic, as they
        understand the operational context and tolerance for false alarms versus
        missed detections.

    Without historical ground truth of "true high-risk situations" correctly labeled,
    empirical tuning through methods like PR curves is not directly implementable in this script.
    The threshold would need to be set based on heuristic understanding or expert input initially.
